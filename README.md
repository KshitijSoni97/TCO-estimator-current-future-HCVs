# TCO-estimator-current-future-HCVs
Total ownership-cost estimation of operating current and future high-capacity vehicles in current infrastructure

This repository contains:
1. A simulink model of an Internal combustion high-capacity vehicle with the environment.
2. A simulink model of an Electric high-capacity vehicle with the environment.
3. A simulink model of a Hybrid combination with an Internal combustion tractor and an Electric semitrailer with the environment.
4. The Matlab scripts required to process the GPS data, run the appropriate model and plot the relevant results.
5. The TCO calculator in excel.

To simulate each of the models and get a TCO estimate, follow the respective instructions:

Step 1: Parameterizing a new vehicle

(a) Internal combustion
- Copy one of the existing Internal combustion vehicle definition folder and rename it according to your vehicle.
- Utilize the data available in the report appendix to choose and parameterize your choice of vehicle.
- The files that need to be parameterized are named hereby : 
- Save all the parameterization files in your vehicle folder.

(b) Electric
- Copy the existing Electric vehicle definition folder and rename it according to your vehicle.
- Utilize the data available from your vehicle manufacturer to parameterize your choice of vehicle.
- The files that need to be parameterized are named hereby : 
- Save all the parameterization files in your vehicle folder.

(c) Hybrid combination
